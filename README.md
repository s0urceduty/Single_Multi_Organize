Single Multi Organize is a new Python library that provides a programmatic blueprint for the "universal organizational law" by strictly separating deep-dive mechanics from broad orchestration. The Single module functions as a high-stakes, fixed-context engine, ensuring that tasks requiring extreme repeatability—such as medical data processing or engineering simulations—are shielded from the chaos of multi-tasking. By utilizing single_lock and single_exec, developers can build a foundation of "dedicated tools" that perform with high precision, mirroring the efficiency of a single-task storage solution where every resource has a predefined, immutable place.

Conversely, the Multi and Blended modules introduce the fluidity needed to navigate complex, changing environments. While the Multi-task functions provide the "big picture" connectivity and adaptive rescheduling necessary for cross-field management, the Blended module targets the "magic" overlap where innovation occurs. By using blend_ratio and blend_solve, the system ensures that the deep domain knowledge of the Single-task nodes is effectively leveraged by the broad-context Multi-task nodes. This prevents the organizational entropy of becoming too siloed or too superficial, creating a balanced system where specialized depth and generalized breadth work in tandem to drive high-value outcomes.

Functions:
-----------

Single-Task Module (Specialist)

1. `single_init(rules)`: This function initializes a process node dedicated to a narrowly defined domain with strict immutable constraints.
2. `single_exec(task)`: This function executes a single high-precision operation while monitoring for any context-breaking deviations.
3. `single_lock()`: This function isolates the current environment to prevent multi-tasking interference or external data contamination.
4. `single_repeat(n)`: This function runs a dedicated task for a set number of cycles to verify absolute consistency and reliability.
5. `single_check()`: This function audits the current process to ensure it remains within the near-zero error tolerance of its field.

Multi-Task Module (Generalist)

6. `multi_scan()`: This function performs a broad, surface-level sweep of all active data streams to provide a system-wide situational overview.
7. `multi_bridge(a, b)`: This function acts as a protocol translator, allowing two disparate specialized nodes to exchange data seamlessly.
8. `multi_flow(path)`: This function orchestrates the sequential movement of information across a wide range of different functional fields.
9. `multi_pivot(shift)`: This function dynamically reassigns resources and reorders priorities based on unpredictable changes in the environment.
10. `multi_synergy()`: This function identifies repeating patterns and overlaps between unrelated tasks to improve overall organizational efficiency.

Blended Module (The Magic)

11. `blend_find()`: This function locates the specific "magic" intersection where deep single-task precision meets broad multi-task application.
12. `blend_ratio()`: This function calculates the optimal mathematical balance between single-task depth and multi-task breadth for a project.
13. `blend_spawn()`: This function creates a hybrid agent that possesses the precision of a specialist and the adaptive flexibility of a generalist.
14. `blend_solve()`: This function applies a single-task high-precision solution to a complex bottleneck identified by the multi-task layer.
15. `blend_audit()`: This function monitors the system to ensure it hasn't become too brittle through over-specialization or too shallow through over-generalization.

Prototype Lib
-----------

The Single Multi Organize (SMO) library is a production-ready prototype now available for deployment, engineered to programmatically enforce the "universal organizational law" of system bifurcation within complex Python architectures. Designed for high-stakes environments—such as automated manufacturing, pharmaceutical research, and multi-node engineering simulations—this library provides a structured API that strictly separates high-precision Single-Task operations from broad Multi-Task orchestration. By utilizing a core logic that mirrors physical tool organization, SMO offers developers the unique ability to "harden" specialized nodes with single_lock to ensure zero-tolerance execution, while simultaneously managing cross-domain fluidity through its adaptive multi_flow and multi_pivot controllers. The library’s most innovative feature, the Blended module, serves as a telemetry engine that identifies the "magic" intersection where deep-domain precision and wide-range adaptability overlap, offering automated resource balancing via blend_ratio to prevent systems from becoming either too brittle or too shallow. This PyPI-ready prototype bridges the gap between organizational theory and functional code, providing a scalable blueprint for building resilient, bifurcated systems that thrive on the synergy between expert depth and generalist breadth.
